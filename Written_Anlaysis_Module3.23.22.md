# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was designed to be able to perform data anlysis on crowdfunding project sot uncover hidden trends. In this module, we were helping Louise.

### Purpose
the purpose of the project was to help Louise determine how different campaigns compared to each other by launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
The biggest challenge was organizing the files correclty so the correct documents were submitted in this assignment. Another big challenge is/was github and determining the method of organization for the files in the course.
I performed the analysis to be able to generate a line graph that showed the amount of successful, failed and cancelled project by month for deliverable one. 
In the second deliverable, I performed an analysis to analyze the outcomes based the goals set by Louise. A line chart was also generated for this analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch DateS
The successful campaigns were from April to May but sharply declined from june to september, slight success in October but declined again over th holidays. 
Cancelled campaigns remained steady throughout the year (execept October no canclled campaigns) 
Failed campaigns were not as consistent as the canceled campaigns but not as drastic as the successful campaigns. There are a drastic increase in October in failed campagins.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Failures increased significantly when the outcomes were 50000 are more.
Successful percentages increased at specific ranges (1000 to 4999), (35000 to 39999), (4000 44999)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
April to May were the the most succesful months for the launch date. The winter months which also holiday season were the least successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on goal?
Percentage Failure and Percentage Successful differed based on the goal. Certain goals are more successful than others.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Its alot of quanitative data, not alot of qualitative data to provide a holistic view of the factors that contributed to the changes observed in the graphs.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
You could do a circle graph or a bar graph
